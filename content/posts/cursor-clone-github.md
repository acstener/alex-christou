Here's a super quick tip that's especially handy if you're new to git or development in general - you can clone GitHub repos without touching the terminal using Cursor.

## How It Works

It's dead simple:
1. Just tell Cursor "Hey, can you clone this repo?"
2. Paste in the repo URL
3. Let Cursor handle the rest

## The Magic Part

What's neat is Cursor doesn't just clone the repo - it handles all the setup too. In the video, we actually ran into a common scenario where we were missing some dependencies, but Cursor sorted that out automatically.

## Quick Steps

1. Ask Cursor to clone the repo
2. Wait a few seconds while it sets everything up
3. Start the development server
4. You're ready to go

The whole process takes seconds, not minutes. You can immediately start making changes and adapting the code however you need.

## Why This Matters

If you're just getting started with development, or you're tired of typing out git commands, this is a proper timesaver. No more worrying about:
- Git command syntax
- Setting up dependencies
- Path issues
- Environment configuration

## The Verdict

For quick prototyping or checking out new projects, this is brilliant. While you'll probably want to learn git properly at some point, having this option in your back pocket is incredibly useful.
