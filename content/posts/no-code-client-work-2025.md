Do you think no-code is still relevant for client work in 2025? If you're doing client projects or freelancing, and maybe you're using Webflow, Framer, WordPress, or Bubble, should you be shifting more over to AI-powered tools?

## What Does the Client Want?

One way of looking at this is: what does a client want?

I used to do a lot of Webflow freelance work. One of the big things that always helped when selling the project to them is that I could kind of pass over the site at the end. I knew that when the project was done, I could shut the doors, pass over the site, and if they were even a tiny bit technical, they could get pretty far with Webflow's UI and editor mode.

If they wanted to make a small change to the title, subheading, or a picture, they could easily do that. Or if they wanted to update the CMS and add a new blog or testimonial, it was pretty easy to do that as well.

## The Handover Problem with AI Tools

So let's say now it's 2025, and all my projects are in Cursor or Bolt, and I'm using Next.js. Is this what my clients would want? Do you think that handing over these projects would be as simple as handing over a no-code project?

I know that I wouldn't want my clients calling me up and saying they've had an issue with deployment and things like that. Yes, you could set up a custom CMS, maybe with Strapi for example, but if you're currently using no-code and that's what you know, then you're creating a lot of extra work for yourself.

## No-Code Is Still Very Relevant

So I think yes, no-code is still very relevant, and I think a lot of clients do want this. Even looking at some job postings for Webflow work, there is a lot of work still coming through there.

It is still relevant, not to mention these companies have been doing huge marketing pushes for the last five or six years. How many times have you heard a Shopify ad on a podcast? It's a lot!

## Using AI to Enhance Your No-Code Workflow

A good way to think about it is: how can you use AI to make your workflow even better? Maybe it's in the design stage. And you know, these tools will surely be adding more AI capabilities into their apps as well as you go. So soon you might not even be asking these questions.

In the meantime, you can definitely experiment with these AI tools. Check out some of the videos on my channel - lots of good stuff there.

So yeah, if you found the video useful, drop a like - always helps out a small YouTuber like me. And other than that, all the best!
