You've probably heard about all the crazy power that comes with using Cursor. But here's the thing - I've been using it for six months without actually writing code. No leetcode training, no memorizing syntax, and I'm not alone in this.

If you're using no-code tools but aren't sure about bridging the gap, or if you're worried about version control, dependencies, or terminal commands - I was in the exact same spot. Let me share how I got here.

## My Journey to Building Full-Stack Apps

### Step 1: Website Builders
It started years back with WordPress - playing with themes and builders. Eventually, I dove deep into Webflow, doing freelance work and working at companies. Here's the thing about Webflow: while it's visual, it teaches you how the front end of websites actually works. Not all no-code tools do this - some have their own weird way of working, and you end up only learning that specific tool.

### Step 2: Understanding Data Flow
After getting comfortable with front-end stuff, I wanted to push further. Enter tools like Zapier and Make.com (formerly Integromat). These automation tools are basically the plumbing of software - they taught me how back-ends work without writing code. I also spent time with Bubble, which combines front and back end all in one.

### Step 3: Real-World Experience
Working as a product manager for about four years helped too. While it wasn't a huge part of where I am now, working with software engineers and understanding how software fundamentally works definitely added to the knowledge base.

## Fast Forward to 2025

Now I can take all this conceptual understanding of how apps work and turn it into prompts for Cursor to do the heavy lifting. No more being restricted by certain apps or edge cases - it's pretty wonderful.

But let's be real - there's still been a massive learning curve. I've been creating React projects, Python projects, doing hackathons, and spending lots of time in Cursor. It's not like I walked in and suddenly became proficient in building React apps. There's been plenty of head-banging moments and problems that an experienced engineer would solve quickly, but took me way longer.

## The New Low-Code/No-Code Development

The cool thing about tools like Claude and Cursor is that when you hit those blocks, you can use them to unblock yourself. It's a new form of development that opens doors for so many more people.

You don't need to:
- Join a programming bootcamp
- Learn syntax
- Master leetcode

(I definitely wouldn't have had the patience for that - and fair play to anyone who's learned the traditional way!)

## Starting Your Journey

If you're looking to get into Cursor, tools like Bolt, Lovable, or v0 can help bridge the gap between no-code and AI development. They're great stepping stones.
