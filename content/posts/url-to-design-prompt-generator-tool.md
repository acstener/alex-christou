Hey, so a couple of weeks ago I made a video where I showed you how you can get a custom design prompt from a website that you like and how to bring that into your own project.

For example, if we look at a lovely website like Member Stack and I want to bring that look and feel - I want to bring some of the spacing and some of that vibe into my own project - how can I do that?

## The Manual Process vs. My New Tool

One way is to go through AI - take a screenshot, get a prompt (using the prompt in my previous video's description), feed that in, get the style guide back, and then bring it into Cursor.

But I built a quick tool to help with this and automate a few steps. Instead of doing it the manual way, you can give this tool a go. It's free!

## How It Works

The tool is super simple to use:

1. Go to [www.alexchristou.co.uk/generate-design-prompt](https://www.alexchristou.co.uk/generate-design-prompt)
2. Paste in the URL of the website you like
3. Click "Generate"

What this does is replace all the manual work. It's going to:
- Fetch a screenshot of the website
- Send it over to OpenAI's Vision AI with a prompt
- Return a nice style guide for you to use

## What You Get

In my example with Member Stack, we get:

1. **The Screenshot**: Which you can save for reference
2. **The Design Style Guide**: Including:
   - Visual style and mood
   - Brand colors
   - Overall aesthetic direction
   - Typography
   - Spacing recommendations
   - Other design elements

Once you've got your design style guide, you can copy it and the screenshot as well, then just paste that into your Cursor agent or any other tool that you're using.

## Next Steps

I know this is quite basic - I just whipped it up quickly with Cursor. Maybe I could use this tool to actually make it better!

Next time you've got a new project or even for improving your current project, give it a spin. Let me know how you get on. I've got some other ideas of how I could build on this, so let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.
