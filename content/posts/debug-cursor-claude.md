# Break Free from AI Debugging Loops with This Simple Prompt

We've all been there - stuck in that frustrating loop of "it doesn't work" with AI tools. Even worse is burning through your credits while going nowhere. After being caught in this cycle maybe 30 or 50 times myself, I've found a method that actually helps break through.

## The Problem

When you're stuck debugging with AI, it usually comes down to two things:
1. You don't fully understand what's going wrong (fair enough, especially if you're newer to AI development)
2. The AI doesn't properly understand what's happening

## The Solution: A Better Debugging Prompt

Here's the prompt that's been a game-changer:

```
We have an issue on [X] page. I need to debug. Please:
1. Lay out exactly how this code works
2. Show all the connecting pieces
3. Include relevant code snippets
4. Think step by step
```

## Why This Works

This prompt does two crucial things:

1. Forces the AI to systematically understand the context, which often helps it spot the issue
2. Gives you clear, structured information you can take to other AI tools (like Claude or DeepSeek) for a fresh perspective

## Making the Most of It

When you use this prompt in Cursor:
- It has your whole codebase in context
- It breaks down the different components
- You get a systematic view of how everything connects

You can then take this output to other AI tools and say "Hey, I'm going to drop in some code - think step by step" and paste in the context. This fresh pair of eyes often spots things you've missed.

## Beyond This Method

Of course, there are loads of other debugging approaches - this video just focuses on one that's particularly effective for breaking out of those AI debugging loops.
