# WebStyle Implementation Progress

## Phase 1 - Completed
- Created directory structure for the WebStyle tool
- Implemented basic API route for screenshot processing (placeholder for Phase 2)
- Created WebStyleForm component for URL input
- Created WebStyle page at /webstyle
- Set up environment variables with placeholder values

## Phase 2 - Completed ✅
- Updated environment variables with actual API keys
- Integrated with ScreenshotOne API to capture real screenshots
- Enhanced the WebStyleForm component to display screenshots
- Added download functionality for screenshots
- Improved UI with better error handling and loading states
- Fixed API integration issues by using direct image URL approach
- Added API key validation to ensure proper configuration
- Implemented comprehensive debugging to troubleshoot API issues

## Phase 3 - Completed ✅
- Implemented two-step API approach to avoid Vercel timeout issues
- Created a separate analyze API route for Vision AI integration using GPT-4o
- Added StyleGuideDisplay component for formatted style guide presentation
- Enhanced WebStyleForm to handle the two-step process
- Added LoadingState component to show different loading stages
- Implemented copy-to-clipboard functionality for style guides
- Added error handling for analysis failures while preserving screenshots
- Created Vercel configuration to extend timeout for analyze API route
- Updated Vision API implementation to use high detail mode for better analysis

## How to Test
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/webstyle` (or the port shown in the console)
3. Enter a website URL (e.g., https://example.com) and click "Generate"
4. You should see the actual screenshot of the website displayed first
5. After a few seconds, the AI-generated style guide should appear below the screenshot
6. You can download the screenshot using the "Save Image" button
7. You can copy the style guide to clipboard using the "Copy to Clipboard" button

## Technical Notes
- The ScreenshotOne API is used to capture website screenshots
- OpenAI's GPT-4o model with vision capabilities is used to analyze screenshots and generate style guides
- We're using a two-step API approach to avoid Vercel timeout issues:
  1. First API call captures the screenshot and returns immediately
  2. Second API call sends the screenshot to Vision AI for analysis
- The Vision API is configured to use "high" detail mode for better image analysis
- Comprehensive error handling allows partial results (screenshot without style guide)
- The Vercel configuration extends the timeout for the analyze API route to 60 seconds

## Next Steps (Phase 4)
- Add history to save previous analyses
- Implement export options for style guides (JSON, CSS variables, etc.)
- Add user settings for customizing the AI prompt
- Create a comparison feature for multiple websites
