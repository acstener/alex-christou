Let's be honest - technical SEO can be a proper pain. There are hundreds of small details to tweak, tags to add, and configurations to sort out. And when your Search Console is looking a bit sad, going through all of that manually isn't exactly thrilling.

I recently found myself in this exact situation with a new blog. Instead of spending hours tweaking things manually, I discovered a much smarter approach using Cursor Agent. Here's how you can let AI handle your technical SEO heavy lifting.

## The Problem 

Technical SEO usually involves:
- Manually optimizing each page
- Setting up proper metadata
- Creating sitemaps and robots.txt
- Ensuring consistent formatting
- And about a hundred other small tasks

Not exactly how you want to spend your afternoon, is it?

## Enter Cursor Agent

Here's where things get interesting. With Cursor Agent (running on Claude 3.5 Sonnet), you can automate this entire process. The magic happens because it:

1. Analyzes your entire project context
2. Works step by step (which is crucial for thorough optimization)
3. Can make bulk changes across multiple files

## How It Works

The process is surprisingly straightforward:

1. Open your project in Cursor
2. Ask it to "do a quick SEO overview and make sure all blog posts are well optimized"
3. Watch as it systematically:
   - Adds dynamic metadata
   - Improves markdown formatting
   - Creates robots.txt
   - Generates a sitemap
   - Makes consistent improvements across all posts

## The Real Game-Changer

The best part? When you need to apply changes across multiple posts (I had seven), you don't need to do each one manually. Just ask Cursor to apply the changes across all posts, and it:
- Takes each post's context into account
- Adds appropriate descriptions and tags
- Maintains consistency while respecting each post's unique content

## Taking It Further

This is just scratching the surface. You could optimize this process even more by:
- Feeding it specific technical SEO requirements
- Including ahrefs technical SEO guidelines
- Setting up custom optimization rules

## Next Steps

Why not give it a try? Fire up your project in Cursor and ask it to do an SEO analysis. You might be surprised by the low-hanging fruit it finds - things that could immediately improve your site's SEO potential.
