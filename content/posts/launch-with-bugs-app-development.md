Don't ever stress about bugs when you're launching. If you're about to launch a product, you're probably a bit nervous - probably testing your API connections, database, and all of that stuff. I saw this post on Reddit, and I've been there. Many people have been there. Thought I'd offer a piece of advice that might help you through this.

I think it's easy to give the advice like "Just launch it, just ship it, YOLO" (who says YOLO in 2025? I don't know). But here's the reframe:

## If people are finding bugs in your app...

...it means they're using it. It means they care enough to engage with it, and you've made it further than probably 99% of product launchers, which get zero users. I've been there as well.

## A real-world example

Here's a story to back up that point: When I worked at a startup, we were growing very well. We had thousands of users being added every week. Revenue was strong, everything was up.

But here's a bit of a secret (which isn't actually a secret) - we had bugs. We had a lot of bugs. It was a very complex product, very technical, and things were never perfect. But users kept coming because they got value out of the tool, and they needed the tool to solve their problem.

## The myth of perfect code

The other thing as well is that obsessing about bugs and the quality of your app is, in a form, kind of procrastinating. You could probably endlessly be finding bugs, fixing something, then something else breaks.

Is it actually realistic to think that you're going to get a perfect codebase within your first launch?

That's not to say that you should ship something from Bolt or v0 with loads of bugs and just a bad app - I'm not saying that. But I think what actually matters is getting the product into people's hands, seeing if people want it, and just getting some momentum under your belt.

Because you might just find that you spend months squishing every single bug, making sure that everything is bulletproof, you launch it... and then there's crickets. It happens. It's happened to me.

## Just launch

If you're hesitating to launch because of bugs, just launch. And when those bug reports do come in, it's a good thing. Smile, say "good" - it means you've got people actually caring. Then you can fix all the other stuff as you go.

Good luck with your launch! And if you're interested in some more content around building and launching, especially with AI, check out the other videos on my channel and subscribe.
