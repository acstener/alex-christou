# Building a RAG-Powered Chatbot: The No-BS Stack

Want to build a RAG chatbot? Here's your stack - no fluff, just what works:

## The Core Stack

* Vercel AI SDK: They've handled the complex AI plumbing. Don't reinvent the wheel here.
* Next.js + Vercel deployment: These are built to work together and makes shipping your app super smooth 
* Supabase for data storage: Plugs right into the stack above. Vector storage, auth, and DB all in one place.

That's it. Could you use 50 other tools? Sure. But this stack will secure the win for you.

## Why This Works

* All AI tools working out of the box with the SDK
* Production-ready infrastructure
* Tools designed to work together
* Minimal DevOps headaches

Don't overcomplicate it. Build the thing.
