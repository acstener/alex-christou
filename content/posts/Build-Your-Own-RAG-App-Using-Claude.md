Ever seen those AI apps that seem to know everything about a specific topic, whether it's research papers, an author's work, or a podcast series? They're called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) apps, and they're pretty powerful. But here's the thing - you don't need to build one from scratch. Claude can help you create your own personal RAG app in minutes.

## Why Use Claude for RAG?

- More cost-effective than building custom
- Significantly faster to set up
- No coding required
- Powerful retrieval capabilities

## Quick Tutorial: Building a Sleep Optimization RAG

Let's walk through creating a RAG app using Andrew Huberman's sleep podcast as an example.

### Step 1: Create a New Project
1. Navigate to Claude's project section
2. Name your project (e.g., "Sleep Optimization")
3. Define your goal clearly

### Step 2: Add Your Knowledge Base
1. Get your content (in our case, the podcast transcript)
2. Click "Add to project knowledge"
3. Either upload files or paste text content
4. Note: A 90-minute podcast transcript only uses about 14% of available capacity

### Step 3: Start Interacting
Once your content is uploaded, you can immediately start asking questions. Claude will search through the uploaded content to provide relevant, accurate answers based on your source material.

## Pro Tip: Custom Styles

Want to make it even better? Create a custom style using examples from your source material. This will make Claude respond in a tone that matches your content's voice.

## Use Cases

You can use this for:
- Research paper analysis
- Podcast knowledge bases
- Documentation
- Personal knowledge management
- Author studies
- Course material synthesis

## Alternative: Building Your Own

If you do want to build a custom RAG app from scratch, check out my video on simple RAG stacks. But for most use cases, Claude's project feature provides everything you need without the complexity.
