# When Cursor Doesn't Understand You, Try This App

Sometimes Cursor just doesn't understand what you mean, and it's super frustrating. You just wanted to get into a good vibe coding session, but you're going around in circles. The longer your chat gets, the more you think, "Does Cursor actually even understand what I'm trying to do here?"

And a lot of times, it doesn't. So maybe you restart the Composer chat, but you're typing away, your fingers are getting a bit tired. Yes, you're not writing many lines of code, but you're still writing essays in this Composer window, which is tiring.

If this sounds like you, then try out this app.

## Introducing Whisper Flow

I'm going to open Whisper Flow here, which has been a big game changer for me. As you can see, apparently I'm a bit of a power user here - top 1%. I've been using this app, and it's essentially a super smart dictation tool. It allows me to explain a lot more in detail what I want to do, give more context, and just speak things naturally.

I find this a really good way to work with Composer.

## How It Works

I've got a shortcut set up, and you can see the overlay at the bottom of the screen. Here's a quick demo of how I use it:

"Hey, I want to make some changes to this website. I'd like the nav to be mixed up a bit, maybe we could have login on the left side. And I'd like the background to be a lovely red for whatever reason. Could you improve their subheading? Instead of 'Say goodbye to boring forms', maybe you could say 'Say hello to amazing forms'."

You can see how I kind of drifted off a little bit there, but that's the magic of this tool - it gets rid of a lot of the "ums" and "ahs" which with a traditional dictation tool would mess up your flow.

With traditional dictation, you'd have to be quite robotic and make sure that you get everything perfectly. With Whisper Flow, you can kind of vibe a bit more, like you're chatting to a dev sitting right next to you that's going to crack on and do the work.

## The Benefits

Yeah, I did waffle on a bit in this example, but Whisper Flow doesn't just remove the "ums" and "ahs" - it basically cuts to the chase. It cleans up what you want to say and gets it in there, ready for Composer. Then we can just go and run that if we want.

It works system-wide in any app and uses AI to do the heavy lifting and quick processing of the text. You can use it for your emails or for creating that amazing LinkedIn content you might be thinking of doing.

## Give It a Try

Once you start using this, you're probably going to keep using it. If you want to try it out for free, use the link in the description. This isn't an ad or anything - I've got 77 subscribers so I don't think I'm going to be retiring off this referral code! But you get $15, I get $15, everyone's a winner.
