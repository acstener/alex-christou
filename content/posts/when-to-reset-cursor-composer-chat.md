You're in Cursor, you've been cooking, but that Composer is getting heavy. You're scrolling up and down, Cursor's forgetting its context, Claude is being slow... it's not good.

So when should you start a new chat? At what point does it start to forget its context?

## The Five Prompt Rule

There's no hard and fast rule, but you should definitely be creating new chats regularly. I know I sometimes get lazy with it.

Cursor compresses its context so it doesn't go bankrupt sending huge API requests to Claude. This means the more context in the chat, the more diluted everything gets.

If you want to be well-disciplined, try the **five prompt rule**:

For every task you're working on, if you can't get Cursor to complete it within five prompts:
1. Reset with a new chat
2. Go back to your original prompt
3. Change it up
4. Reapproach it
5. Try something fresh

## Why This Works

The longer the thread goes, the worse it gets. The AI starts to lose focus, misses important details from earlier in the conversation, and generally becomes less effective.

By using super punchy, focused Composer sessions, you'll get better results and avoid that frustrating experience of an AI that seems to have forgotten what you're working on.

## Bonus Tip

If you're stuck in a debugging loop with Cursor and can't escape it, I've got a tip in another video you can check out (link in description).
