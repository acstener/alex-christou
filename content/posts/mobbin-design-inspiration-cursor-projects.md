Super quick video here! Let's say you're working on your Cursor project and you're just not quite happy with how the design looks. As you can see here, this is not a piece of art by any means.

Here's a place you can find a bunch of different screens and websites for inspiration, so you can use them as a bit of a North Star - something to strive towards or take inspiration from.

## Introducing Mobbin

The app/website is called Mobbin, and they are a collection of different websites where you can click into one and look at all the different UI flows, marketing pages, and everything.

It is a paid tool, but you can get pretty far with the free plan.

## Why Mobbin is Great for Design Inspiration

Here's why I think this is really good for design inspiration:

1. **Real-World Examples**: These are real companies, many of them doing well at the moment and growing a lot. So you can see what kind of cutting-edge websites and screens are looking like.

2. **Professional Quality**: Obviously, these companies invest a bunch of resources (design and dev) into these pages, so why not learn from the best and adopt best practices?

3. **Practical Designs**: Unlike sites like Dribbble, which are much more focused towards design exploration or showing off design skills with more experimental stuff, Mobbin showcases designs that actually work in the real world.

With Dribbble, it might be good for vibe and feel, but with Mobbin, you're actually getting real companies, real screens, real flows, and all that good stuff.

## How to Use Mobbin with Cursor

There are a bunch of ways we can go from Figma or design to Cursor, but in the simplest way:

1. Find a landing page you like (let's look at Frame.io as an example)
2. Open it up and take a screenshot
3. Drop that screenshot into Cursor and ask Cursor to do the work

You could also create a prompt from this to create a bit of a style guideline (check out my other videos for more on this technique).

## Next Steps

Next time you're stuck for inspiration or want a bit of guidance on what to do next to improve your project's design, check out Mobbin.
