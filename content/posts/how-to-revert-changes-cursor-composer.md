So you're working in Cursor, you're deep in a project, you're deep in the Composer window, but things aren't going well. Maybe you haven't set up Version Control, and you're starting to panic. Here's how to really quickly revert changes.

## The Simple Solution

Let's say I'm going to make the background a really weird red for whatever reason. So here's our lovely red, and you know what? We really don't like it.

Let's not panic! What we need to do is:

1. Scroll up to the point in the Composer where we were happy (I was happy before we made it this weird red)
2. This could be all the way up in your conversation if you've gone down a deep rabbit hole
3. Click the "Restore" button next to "Checkpoint created"

This will revert all the changes that you made back to the time of that prompt. It will show us our prompt again, it will revert the changes, we're fresh, we're back to where we were. No stress!

## Why This Matters

I feel like a lot of people don't know about this feature, so hopefully this helped you, especially if you've not set up your Version Control yet.

This can be a lifesaver when:
- You've made unwanted changes
- You've gone too far down a path that isn't working
- You want to try a different approach without losing your progress
- You're experimenting and want a quick way to get back to a known good state
