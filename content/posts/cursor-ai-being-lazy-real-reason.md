Ever had one of those days? You've been coding for hours, it's getting late, and suddenly your AI assistant seems to be giving up on you. It's not responding properly, not thinking things through, just... missing the mark completely.

And yeah, maybe you've even hit that point where you're typing in ALL CAPS: "PLEASE FIX THIS, I'M GETTING TIRED." Been there, done that.

## What's Really Going On?

Sure, AI can get a bit slower at different times of the day depending on how busy the servers are. But here's the thing - there might be a simpler explanation.

It's not about finding the perfect prompt hack. Sometimes the best solution is to:
- Stop
- Take a breath
- Go for a walk
- Grab a coffee
- Or if it's late, just shut down and sleep on it

## The Plot Twist

Here's the thing about LLMs (Large Language Models) - they're actually way more consistent than people think. You know who isn't as consistent? Us humans, especially after a long or stressful day.

The quality of your AI output - whether you're using Claude, Cursor, or Copilot - is directly linked to the quality of your prompts and how you communicate what you want. And let's be honest, if you're tired, your prompts are probably not at their best. Once you hit the ALL CAPS stage, it's probably game over until tomorrow.

## The Real Hack

I've been there multiple times - hours of going around in circles, trying all sorts of prompts to get the AI to do what I need. But you know what's actually one of the biggest hacks? Shutting down for the night and coming back fresh in the morning.

It sounds cliche, but there's something magical about spending hours wrestling with a problem, then coming back the next morning and nailing it in one shot within 15 minutes. That's a good feeling.

## Bonus Point

Here's another perk of taking a break - you're not burning through credits running around in circles! 

## Still Stuck?

If your AI is still being "lazy" and you're stuck in a debugging loop, check out my video on the prompt that can help break out of that debug cycle.
