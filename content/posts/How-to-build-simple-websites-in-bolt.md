# How to Get AI Tools to Build Actual Websites (Not Web Apps)

Here's a quick one that'll save you some headaches when working with AI website builders like Bolt.

## The Problem

If you've played around with these tools, you've probably noticed they love defaulting to complex web apps. Ask for a simple recipe site? Boom - you get a React app with state management, routing, and a bunch of other stuff you don't need.

## The Simple Fix

The key is in the prompt. Just add this magic phrase:

*"Create a simple static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript site"*

That's it. Seriously.

## Why This Works

These tools are trained on modern web development patterns, where everything's a web app. By explicitly asking for a static site, you're breaking that default behavior and getting what you actually need: clean, simple code you can deploy anywhere.

## Quick Example

Let's say you want a recipe finder site. Instead of asking:
- ❌ "Build me a recipe finder website"

Say:
- ✅ "Build me a recipe finder website using simple static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"

The difference? The first gets you a React app with unnecessary complexity. The second gets you clean files you can actually use.

## The Real Win

You end up with straightforward code that:
- Deploys anywhere
- Loads faster
- Is easier to maintain
- Doesn't need a build process

Sometimes simpler is better. Don't let AI overcomplicate your projects.
