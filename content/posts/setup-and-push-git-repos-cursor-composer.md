Ready to push your project to GitHub? If you're newer to development, you might be reaching for that Git cheat sheet or asking ChatGPT for terminal commands. In 2025, there's a better way: Cursor Composer.

## Quick Guide to Pushing Code with Composer

1. Create a new GitHub repo
2. Copy the repo URL
3. Open Cursor Composer
4. Simply tell it: "Push this project to this repo"
5. Let the agent handle all git commands

## Why This Matters

- No need to memorize git commands
- Saves time on repository setup
- Reduces potential for command errors
- Handles initialization, adding files, and pushing in one go

## Pro Tip

You can also use Composer for cloning repositories. Check out their video tutorial for more details on that process.

## Summary

What used to be a multi-step process with several terminal commands is now a single instruction to Cursor Composer. The agent handles all the git operations while you can focus on more important tasks - like having a nice cup of tea.
