Ever been in a super long Claude conversation where you're scrolling up and down, trying to find that one thing you remember but can't quite locate? Maybe you're hitting Command+F, jumping between different contexts and problems? There's actually a solution to this - forking your chat.

While it's not a native Claude feature (yet), there's a way to add it. Let me show you how it works.

## What Does Forking Do?

Say you've got Claude working on multiple tasks - maybe a Spotify-style dashboard and a CRM dashboard. Instead of manually copying everything to start a new chat when you want to continue working on just the CRM part, forking lets you branch off seamlessly.

## How It Works

The extension adds a fork button that looks almost native to Claude. You can:
- Include files from the original chat
- Set other options
- Create a new chat with all the previous context

The best part? You can keep your original chat and go down different paths with your forks.

## Setting It Up

1. Head to the Greasy Fork Claude Fork Conversation page
2. Install the Tampermonkey Chrome extension
3. Install the Claude fork script
4. Check your extensions - you'll see the Claude fork script with some options to turn it on/off

## Quick Tips
- The extension isn't your typical Chrome extension - it's a bit more niche
- You can find it on Greasy Fork (link in the description)
- It's free to use
- You can toggle it on and off as needed

While it takes a couple of steps to set up, it's a game-changer if you're dealing with long, complex conversations in Claude.
