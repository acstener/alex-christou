# WebStyle Implementation Progress

## Phase 1 - Completed
- Created directory structure for the WebStyle tool
- Implemented basic API route for screenshot processing (placeholder for Phase 2)
- Created WebStyleForm component for URL input
- Created WebStyle page at /webstyle
- Set up environment variables with placeholder values

## Phase 2 - Completed âœ…
- Updated environment variables with actual API keys
- Integrated with ScreenshotOne API to capture real screenshots
- Enhanced the WebStyleForm component to display screenshots
- Added download functionality for screenshots
- Improved UI with better error handling and loading states
- Fixed API integration issues by using direct image URL approach
- Added API key validation to ensure proper configuration
- Implemented comprehensive debugging to troubleshoot API issues

## How to Test
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/webstyle` (or the port shown in the console)
3. Enter a website URL (e.g., https://example.com) and click "Generate"
4. You should see the actual screenshot of the website displayed
5. You can download the screenshot using the "Save Image" button

## Technical Notes
- The ScreenshotOne API is used to capture website screenshots
- We're using the direct API URL approach rather than JSON response for better reliability
- API key validation is performed before attempting to capture screenshots
- Comprehensive error handling is implemented to provide clear feedback

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
- Integrate with Vision AI to analyze screenshots and generate style guides
- Enhance UI to display style guides in a user-friendly way
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for the style guide
