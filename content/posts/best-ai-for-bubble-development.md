If you're working with Bubble and looking for the best AI assistant to help with your projects, I've got a quick answer for you. This came up in the no-code subreddit recently, and I thought it'd be worth making a short video (and now blog post) to show you the solution.

## Claude Projects is Your Best Bet

While there are plenty of AI tools out there, Claude Projects is specifically designed to handle this kind of thing really well. Here's why it's your best option for Bubble development:

1. It already has good knowledge of Bubble out of the box
2. You can customize it with specific Bubble documentation
3. It retains context throughout your project

## How to Set It Up

Setting up a Bubble assistant in Claude Projects is super simple:

1. Head to [claude.ai/projects/create](https://claude.ai/projects/create)
2. Name your project (e.g., "Bubble Assistant - Tool to help me with Bubble projects")
3. Click "Create Project"

That's it for basic setup! Claude already has decent knowledge of Bubble, so you can start asking questions right away.

## Making It Even Better

Want to level it up? Let's say you're working specifically with API integrations in Bubble:

1. Find the relevant Bubble documentation (API docs in this case)
2. Copy the content
3. In your Claude Project, click "Add to project knowledge"
4. Select "Add text content"
5. Paste in the documentation

Now when you ask Claude specific questions about Bubble APIs, it will reference those exact docs you uploaded. And the best part? This only uses a tiny percentage of the project's capacity, so you can add lots more documentation as needed.

Right now, this is hands down the best AI solution for helping with Bubble projects and other no-code tools.
