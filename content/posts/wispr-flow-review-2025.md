Very quick Wispr Flow review here. As you can see, I'm a bit of a power user, which is a weird flex, but I'm using it a lot.

## The Short Version

Off the bat: Is it good? Yes. Is it worth trying out? Definitely, if you're writing code or doing any content work. Is it worth the money? Again, I think if you're using AI a lot and talking to AI, it makes it a much more smooth experience.

Even better, you can try it for free using the code in the description. No, it's not an ad - I've only got 77 subs, so not going to be retiring off that!

## What Makes Wispr Flow Good?

What makes it great? I think the obvious thing that makes it worth trying is that it's just a really strong dictation tool.

If you've ever used dictation before, you know that it can save you a bit of time, but you'll have a lot of fluff in there, a lot of filler words. Or maybe you change your mind, or maybe say one thing but then actually midway through, you change your mind. Normal dictation tools can't handle that.

Wispr Flow does AI processing to the dictation super quick, and it cleans up all your text. It removes all the fluff, it removes all the filler words, it makes it sound normal and look good.

So yes, for chatting with AIs or doing something in Cursor for example, it's amazing. But even for WhatsApp, Slack, emails - it can be good.

## Cool Features

What else is cool? I like how they've got a few stats here. They've also got a dictionary where you can add your words so when you speak, it will understand and it won't misspell common things that you're using. I haven't actually used this, but I probably should. Apparently, it autolearns Claude - again, pretty cool.

It's got a history as well where you can see all the stuff, and everything is stored on device so any privacy concerns are all good.

And yeah, the fact that it's system-wide means you can literally use it anywhere there's a text input field, which is nice.

## Areas for Improvement

No tool is perfect, right? What could make Wispr Flow even better?

I think making it feel a bit more native with Mac would be cool. Raycast, for example, feels like such a native experience. Wispr Flow has a shortcut where you can do it and you can see it here, but it does feel like it's slightly on top of macOS for now. I'm sure they're going to get there.

This is just a nitpick - it's barely a small thing - but for any of you product design nerds out there, I had some issues with a little button here on the dock bar which was annoying. I couldn't find the button to hide it, but it is in settings. If you come to settings, you've got the "show up in Dock" option, which makes sense for getting people to use it, but for whatever reason last week I couldn't remove that. Again, just a small thing.

## Feature Requests

If I had a feature request, maybe it would be cool to do a bit of post-processing. Perhaps I could give some prompts that would tweak my text slightly for different apps. Maybe be able to tweak and experiment with the prompt there and how it cleans up the text.

Let's say I'm sending very formal emails - maybe it'd be cool to have a formal voice where I could just speak normally and then it would change it into that tone. Maybe that's a separate product, but I feel like it could sit within this pretty nicely.

Maybe you could even have some shortcut keys for different voices or different tones - bit far-fetched, but it's definitely possible.

## Final Thoughts

Like I said, definitely worth a try, and if you use the code that's in the description, you get $15, I get $15, everyone's a winner. So do try it out, especially if you're using these AI coding tools, which if you're watching this video, you may well be.
