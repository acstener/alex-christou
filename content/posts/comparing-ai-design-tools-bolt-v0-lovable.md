It's the classic question right now - which AI design tool is best? Sure, they might each be better at different things, but today we're looking purely at design. We're going to put them to the test with some one-shot prompts and see which one comes out on top.

My bet's on either Lovable or v0 - been hearing good things about v0 lately. Let's see how it goes!

## Test 1: SaaS Landing Page

First up, we tried a SaaS-style landing page. Here's what we got:

- **Bolt**: Nice hero section, but those logos were a bit questionable. It's decent though - very simple, almost a bit bootstrappy, but looks better than many landing pages out there.
- **Lovable**: Very nice, minimalist. Pretty similar to Bolt actually, given we used the same prompt.
- **v0**: Bit chunky on the font sizes and stuff, but nice gradient in the heading. Clean hero section, no logos.

Honestly, similar results with no clear winner, but because of those broken logos in Bolt, I'd give this one to Lovable.

## Test 2: Fitness Dashboard

Next we went with a simpler prompt - just "create a dashboard for fitness app which tracks health". Wanted to test their creativity a bit more here.

- **Bolt**: Nice clean dashboard. Tried to have a placeholder but didn't quite work. Nice spacing, nice icons, nice colors, little profile picture up there. Good job.
- **v0**: Pretty basic. Icons aren't quite there, colors are a bit off (who's picking this green?). Decent effort but sizing seems off.
- **Lovable**: Wow! Got that animation with the chart, nice colors, nice icons. Love the touches.

This one's between Lovable and Bolt. I liked how Bolt had the nav and profile picture, but Lovable just looks fresher - more like a Stripe dashboard. Lovable takes round 2!

## Test 3: Spotify Clone

For the final round, we tried a Spotify-style project.

- **v0**: Not great. Would've been nice to have some placeholders or even just gradient colors.
- **Lovable**: It's alright. The placeholders don't make it look amazing.
- **Bolt**: Wow! It's not perfect, but it's a very good start. Having the images makes it look so much better. We've got top charts, recently played, nice spacing, decent color, nice gradient, nice nav bar.

Bolt takes this one - if Lovable had the images it would've helped it out a lot.

## The Verdict

Final score: Lovable 2, Bolt 1, v0 left in the dust. 

Looks like Bolt can do a bit more with media, but Lovable seems to be more consistent and stable. Right now, Lovable seems to be edging towards being the best of these tools - but it chops and changes all the time.

Testing like this is actually a pretty good (and fun) way to figure out which one you should use for your projects. Speaking of Lovable and design, check out my review of their Figma import function.
