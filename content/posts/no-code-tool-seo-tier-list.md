# No-Code SEO in 2025: The Tier List

Right, let's get into it. If SEO matters for your no-code project, you need to know which platforms actually deliver results versus which ones are just marketing fluff. I've scaled products to millions of monthly users with these tools, so here's my tier list.

## The Framework

This isn't about theoretical capabilities - it's about what these tools give you straight out of the box for SEO and how much faff you'll need to sort out yourself. Sure, you can make any of these work if you're determined enough, but let's be honest about which ones are actually built for it.

## The Tier List

### S-Tier
*Nothing's made it here yet. The perfect no-code SEO tool is still a myth.*

### A-Tier

**Webflow**
- Scaled a content directory to millions of monthly users with this
- Proper CMS foundation with rapid page deployment
- Getting to 80% SEO optimisation is straightforward
- Last 20% needs proper technical knowledge
- Plugin ecosystem is getting there

**WordPress**
- Not my cup of tea, but you can't argue with the numbers
- Powers a ridiculous chunk of the web for good reason
- Massive plugin ecosystem for SEO
- Dead simple to start publishing
- Solid SEO foundation from the start

### B-Tier

**Shopify**
- Decent e-commerce SEO potential
- Not brilliant straight away
- Needs proper optimisation work
- Watch those massive product images
- Relies heavily on plugins for proper SEO

**Framer**
- Quite lightweight naturally
- Can build properly quick landing pages
- CMS exists but isn't the focus
- Not built for SEO primarily
- Good for specific use cases

### C-Tier

**Replit, Lovable, Bolt**
- Brilliant tools, wrong job
- Default to web apps = heavier load
- Too complex for basic SEO needs
- Crawler optimisation isn't a priority
- Content publishing feels bolted on

### D-Tier

**Bubble**
- Used to be the business
- SEO was never the priority
- Even blank pages are heavy
- Page speed insights are grim
- Better shouts exist for content-heavy projects

## The Reality Check

The gap between marketing waffle and SEO reality is massive in no-code. If SEO matters for your project:

1. Webflow or WordPress are your best shout
2. Shopify works if you're ready to put the graft in
3. Avoid tools that prioritise app functionality over content
4. Simple and light usually beats feature-heavy for SEO

## Looking Forward

The no-code SEO landscape changes fast. Tools that were rubbish at SEO last year might sort themselves out next year. But right now, this is what you're working with.
