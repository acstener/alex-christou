Is no-code still relevant for building apps in 2025? If you're new to building websites or apps, you've got a lot of tools to pick from. Is it worth picking one of these, investing time to learn it, and then using that? Or do you bite the bullet and get AI to help you code?

## It Depends on What You're Building

I know "it depends" isn't a great answer, but I think it mainly depends on what you're building. There are still a lot of pros to no-code tools, even in a time when a new AI tool seems to be coming out every week.

## Three Key Questions to Ask Yourself

It comes down to a couple of things:
1. Are you building something you just want to be functional and to just work?
2. Are you building to get more into the AI space?
3. Are you learning to build so you can build more things down the line, building knowledge and skills?

## The Case for Sticking with No-Code

If you want something that just works, you should still consider no-code. Here's why:

Yes, with AI you can get to something that works really quickly, almost within seconds. But even once you've got that prototype, there are still a lot of things you need to do and hurdles to cross. You're going to run into problems.

Not to say you can't work through those problems - you can work it out - but you're going to run into a lot more of these problems than you would in a no-code tool.

Yes, in a no-code tool there might be a bit of a learning curve, but once you've got the website or app in that tool, it's going to be a lot easier to publish, connect your custom domain, and have things that work.

## The Deployment Challenge with AI Tools

There are a lot of people that use tools like Bolt or v0, and they get their app up, and then they're like, "What's next? What do I even do? How do I deploy? What is GitHub?"

I also think that the audience that uses no-code tools - not all of them want to suddenly pivot to building with all these new AI-powered tools.

## Think About Your Use Case

Let's say you're just setting up a website for your business. Do you really need to fire up Cursor, set up all these environments, and set up a local environment? No, it doesn't make sense. No-code is definitely still relevant for that.

But on the other hand, if you want to get into the space more and more, if you want to progressively build harder things, then I'd say jump into the AI coding space.

## Want to Know More?

If you want to find out more about some of these tools, check out some other videos on the channel. And if you are doing client work, I've also made a similar video: "Is No-Code Relevant for Client Work?" because I think that's a slightly different topic.
