# The Fast Track: A PM's Guide to Getting Into Code

Most PMs already understand how software works - you've shipped products, worked with engineers. That's your advantage. Use it.

You don't need to learn python or spend months studying ML theory to start building.

Here's the fastest path I've found:

1. Skip the local setup nightmare. Start with in-browser environments like Bolt.new, v0 or Lovable. Why? Because you'll be building in 5 minutes instead of spending 2 days setting up your laptop

2. Use your PM skills. Write clear prompts - like if you were writing specs for an engineer. Start basic and build up confidence. You'll be surprised how far you can get here

3. Move onto local tools once you've got wins in the locker: Tools like Cursor and Windsurf. More complex, but much more powerful once you move on.

No need to overthink this. You've got the core skills - you just need the right tools to get going.
